The City’s real estate market is dominated by luxury developments, while low- and middle-income residents struggle with high rent prices and limited availability of affordable units. Moreover, gentrification has displaced long-time residents in many neighborhoods, exacerbating inequality. Finally, the City’s zoning laws and slow pace of new construction have contributed to the lack of affordable housing options, creating significant barriers for those seeking stable, affordable homes.\n\nDifferent areas of the city are differentially impacted by the growing population. This interactive map highlights NYC’s population and demographic breakdown by zip code as of 2021; zip codes with larger populations are visualized in increasingly darker shades. The data comes from City and census sources.\nAdditionally, you will find a simple breakdown of the top 5 most populous zip codes below:\n\n\n\nZip Code\nBorough\nPopulation\n\n\n\n\n11368\nQueens\n113,741 people\n\n\n11211\nBrooklyn\n107,788 people\n\n\n11226\nBrooklyn\n101,747 people\n\n\n11373\nQueens\n101,548 people\n\n\n11220\nBrooklyn\n101,225 people\n\n\n\nTo address the needs of the growing population, we propose taking the following targeted action.\n\nBuild affordable housing on existing empty lots\nAmend restrictive zoning laws\nConvert empty office spaces to apartments\n\nIn particular I would like to emphasize the housing potential of formerly commercial spaces. Other regions of the country have had success turning former shopping malls into housing, and NYC’s surplus of office space could be similarly revitalized.\n\n\nI look forward to your response and to working together!\nSincerely,"
